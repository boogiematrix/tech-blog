# tech-blog
  ## Description
    This is a blog that allows the user to sign up and post their thoughts on what is tech and what is NOT tech. They can then view their post on their dashboard, or view posts from all users on the homepage. They can edit or delete their own posts, and comment on other users' posts, things like: "kudos, very tech my king," or "so close, but not tech, next time...". This site uses express, handlebars, sequelize, and mysql.
